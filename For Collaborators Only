Hello Collaborators of our project!
Now that we have the HTML skeleton challenge on our repository,
the next step is to help create the JavaScript challenge.
Please put ideas on this repository. I recommend posting them on the master branch so everyone can see it.
If you have any questions, please ask me.
Thank you.

Have fun coding away!
